We bring the work experience to life using immersive technology (webXR), where our AI-powered interactions ensure objective feedback and help you map out your career path.

* **Personal advice.** Our reporting tool creates a personal summary for each student that can be supplemented by the teacher with the knowledge from the student tracking system.
* **Open.** We believe in the power of open-source and open teaching materials and try to model our business model accordingly.
* **By (former) students, for students.** Our young team has experienced the challenges in career choice first-hand and is determined to protect future generations from making the wrong choices.
